#Write a program that calculates and displays a person’s body mass index (BMI). The BMI is often used to determine whether a person is overweight or underweight for his or her
#height. A person’s BMI is calculated with the following formula:

#where weight is measured in pounds and height is measured in inches.
#The program should ask the user to enter his or her weight and height, and then display the user’s BMI.
#The program should also display a message indicating whether the person has optimal weight, is underweight, or is overweight.
#A person’s weight is considered to be optimal if his or her BMI is between 18.5 and 25.
#If the BMI is less than 18.5, the person is considered to be underweight.
#If the BMI value is greater than 25, the person is considered to be overweight.

weight = float(input("Enter your weight in pounds: "))
height = float(input("Enter your height in inches: "))

bmi = weight *  (703 / (height**2))

print('Your BMI is', (format(bmi, '.2f')))

if bmi <=18.5:
    print("Underweight")
elif bmi >= 25:
    print("Overweight")
else:
    print("Normalweight")
